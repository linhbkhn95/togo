### Prerequisite

* docker-compose: for setup everything quickly
* direnv: For manage and auto switch config on `.envrc` https://direnv.net/
* go 1.16+ with enable module support

You can install it by those command (not sure it can working properly)
```
## For macOS users
$ make install-osx

# for Linux user
$ sudo echo this command to promp password
$ make install-linux
```


### Application Config

* Set inside `.envrc`

```
$ cat .envrc
export HTTP_PORT=5050
```

* Auto env by command `direnv allow`

```
$ direnv allow
direnv: loading .envrc
```

### Preparing the Infrastructure
* init postgres with docker-compose
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
* init tables schema
```
$ make migrate up
```
### Run

* run run server
```
$ go run cmd/server/main.go server or make run
```
### Overview
This is a simple backend for a good old todo service, right now this service can handle login/list/create simple tasks.  
To make it run:
- `go run main.go`
- Import Postman collection from `docs` to check example

Candidates are invited to implement below requirements but the point is not to resolve everything in a perfect way but selective what you can do best in a limited time.  
Thus, there is no correct-or-perfect answer, your solutions are way for us to continue the discussion and collaboration.
 
### Requirements
Right now a user can add many task as they want, we want ability to limit N task per day.

Example: users are limited to create only 5 task only per day, if the daily limit is reached, return 4xx code to client and ignore the create request.
#### Backend requirements
- A nice README on how to run, what is missing, what else you want to improve but don't have enough time
- Fork this repo and show us your development progess by a PR.
- Write integration tests for this project
- Make this code DRY
- Write unit test for `services` layer
- Change from using `SQLite` to `Postgres` with `docker-compose`
- This project include many issues from code to DB strucutre, feel free to optimize them.
#### Frontend requirements
- A nice README on how to run, what is missing, what else you want to improve but don't have enough time
- https://github.com/manabie-com/mana-do
- Fork the above repo and show us your development progess by a PR.
#### Optional requirements
- Write unit test for `storages` layer
- Split `services` layer to `use case` and `transport` layer

### DB Schema
```sql
-- users definition

CREATE TABLE users (
	id TEXT NOT NULL,
	password TEXT NOT NULL,
	max_todo INTEGER DEFAULT 5 NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT users_PK PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

INSERT INTO users (id, password, max_todo) VALUES('firstUser', 'example', 5);

-- tasks definition

CREATE TABLE tasks (
	id TEXT NOT NULL,
	content TEXT NOT NULL,
	user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_date TEXT NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT tasks_PK PRIMARY KEY (id),
	CONSTRAINT tasks_FK FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```
